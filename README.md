# Ansible: Monitor playbook executions

I planned to use an ansible, a configuration management tool, in a production system. When it comes to the production system, 
it is important to know which configurations are applied successfully and which aren't. 
After spending some time on the internet, I couldn't find an easy way to monitor failed execution. So I come up with this solution.

## How to use it?
Run the following command 
```
docker-compose up -d
```
